## 🪪 About Me
### Work Life! 👩‍💻
I started off my career as a software engineer– went to uni for it, and took the standard job path. While I loved the coding parts of the job, I felt like there was something I was missing. I was at a smaller company that mainly sent engineers to conferences at the time, I met a Developer Advocate on contract with the company that showed me the world of DevRel, and I knew I found my place! 
I have experience with a myriad of languages and tech stacks: Python, TypeScript, Java, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and golang – just to mention a few! Learning is my passion, so there isn't something out there that I won't try! I love a challenge!

### Personal Life! ☀️
- I'm based in Denver, United States and have lived in the state of Colorado for the majority of my life. 
- I speak (sadly, now conversational) Spanish and moved to Spain 6 months before COVID hit. I made the hard decision to move back to the US, but I definitely want to move back in the future, as I am a dual US/Luxembourg citizen!
- In my free time, I teach fitness classes: studio rowing (think cycle classes on an erg machine) and dance fitness.
- A few other hobbies of mine: spending time with my amazing husband and our 4-year-old corgi doodle, traveling, hiking, cooking, and photography every now and then.

## 🧭 My Guiding Principles

I heavily rely on a learning mindset with using feedback as a way to grow! I appreciate transparency, curiosity, experimentation, and collaboration in my workspace. 

## 🧠 How I Think and Make Decisions
- I am a problem solver. I usually approach most scenarios by working to find a solution. 
- I try to break down the bits of information I know, what I need to find, and start working from there! 
- I am fast-paced, yet try to make sure I weigh all options and consult as many people/sources before making a decision.
- I can process both out loud and asynchronously, but prefer to do it asynchronously first.


## 💬 Communication Preferences
The best way to get in touch with me is Slack, unless the topic of conversation turns into a large discussion. I like to have time to process information first, but do not mind having people book time with me as needed!
I appreciate clear, detailed messages with as much context as possible.

## 🤝 How I Like to Collaborate
I love collaboration and working with so many ideas! I love to approach collaboration by making meaningful connections with the people I'm working with first. This helps me build trust and understand how everyone works and approaches different topics before diving in. I also love to give and receive feedback, and I try to make this a large part of collaborating with others.

## 📆 Calls With Me
I prefer calls with a structured agenda, if possible! I don't have a preference whether that's creating the agenda together or separately, as long as we are able to achieve what needs to get done!


## 🔁 Feedback Culture
Feedback is one of the main pieces I use to grow and learn. I will take all kinds of feedback, and would love to have them written down (even if it's after the moment) so I can go back to them later. 
I am also comfortable with sharing feedback to others as well. I try to be as clear and concise as possible, but understand I make mistakes. I am not worried about having the right opinion, but rather focus on learning for the next time! I am flexible, so please let me know if how I give feedback doesn't work for you!


## 📚 What I’m Working On / Learning
I'm currently focused on onboarding to Midnight and learning as much as I can! 
### How can you support?
- Any resources, information, or context about the product, company, culture, etc. is helpful!
- Patience! I'm excited to get up and running with the team, but please understand that there is always a learning curve, and I may make mistakes or miss information along the way.


## ✨ Things That Make Me Happy
- I love constant communication! This doesn't have to be paragraphs long, but even an emoji reaction is great to know that things are understood and messages are clear
- Quick check-ins, please! I know how easy it is to get stuck in a rabbit hole, so being able to come up for air is appreciated.
- Small things that will make me smile. Have a picture of your pet you want to share? I would love to see it. Need to share an article, even if it's for fun? I want to read it! 

## 🚫 Nuances About Me
- While I can bring an extroverted persona, I am truly an introvert. I need time to recharge and focus during and after collaboration sessions.
- I overexplain sometimes, and ask for extra context constantly. I want to make sure I get the full picture!
- I am not a fan of unclear priorities and too much silence. The more communication, the better!
